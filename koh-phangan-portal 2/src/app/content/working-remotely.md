# Working Remotely from Koh Phangan: Digital Nomad Guide

## Introduction

Koh Phangan has evolved from a backpacker and party destination into one of Southeast Asia's most appealing digital nomad hubs. The island offers a unique combination of tropical lifestyle, growing infrastructure, vibrant community, and relatively affordable living costs that attracts remote workers from around the world. This guide covers everything you need to know about working remotely from Koh Phangan, from internet connectivity and workspaces to building professional networks and maintaining productivity in paradise.

## Internet Connectivity

Reliable internet is the lifeblood of remote work, and Koh Phangan's connectivity has improved dramatically in recent years.

### Fiber Internet

Fiber optic internet is now available in most developed areas of the island:
- **3BB**: Most widely available provider, packages from 500-1,500 THB/month
- **TRUE**: Good coverage in main areas, similar pricing to 3BB
- **AIS**: Limited coverage but expanding, competitive speeds

Typical fiber speeds range from 100/50 Mbps to 1000/500 Mbps depending on the package. Installation usually takes 3-7 days and may require a Thai contact or landlord's assistance.

### Mobile Data

4G/5G coverage is excellent in populated areas:
